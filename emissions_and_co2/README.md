FA20 COGS108 Group 057 Project Repo

For our project, we are inspecting the relationship betwen traffic volume and CO2 emissions in the counties of California. We are looking at data reported between 2011 and 2017 to see whether the relationship is temporally continuous. After considering possible confounding factors and outliers, we created different visualizations to analyze the relationship between traffic volume and CO2 emissions. We came to the conclusion that there is a positive linear relationship between the two variables.
